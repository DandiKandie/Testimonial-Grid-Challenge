## Overview

I picked this challenge, because I have always found CSS Grid hard to really comprehend. Especially when trying to create something from scratch, what I found most difficult was knowing how many columns would be needed for something I could not quite visualize.

This challenge really helped me to figure out where I struggle, and what I need to improve and learn more about.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-    View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

-    Semantic HTML5 markup
-    CSS custom properties
-    Flexbox
-    CSS Grid
-    Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that, proper HTML set up is key to success, I had to reformat my HTML document three times, before I could get the challenge to look the way I wanted.

### Continued development

After completing this challenge, I have realized that I need assistance with better understanding accessibility tags, and the more advanced properties of CSS Grid.

There was an SVG in the asset files, I would like to learn more on how to incorporate these into my future projects.

### Useful resources

-    [GRID by malven](https://grid.malven.co/) - I used this to get a better visual on how to span the columns and rows, and what the proper syntax should be.
