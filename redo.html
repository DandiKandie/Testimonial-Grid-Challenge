							the free intro course and found it incredibly
							fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next
							12 weeks was the best - and most grueling -
							time of my life. Since completing the course,
							I’ve successfully switched careers, working
							as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.”

							Such a life-changing experience. Highly

							“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never
							written a line of code. I needed some
							structure from professionals who can help me
							learn programming step by step. I was
							encouraged to enroll by a former student of
							theirs who can only say wonderful things
							about the program. The entire curriculum and
							staff did not disappoint. They were very
							hands-on and I never had to wait long for
							assistance. The agile team project, in
							particular, was outstanding. It took my
							learning to the next level in a way that no
							tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often
							referred to it during interviews as an
							example of my developent experience. It
							certainly helped me land a job as a
							full-stack developer after receiving multiple
							offers. 100% recommend!”
